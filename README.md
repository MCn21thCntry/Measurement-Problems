# Comparison of Conversion Rates of Bidding Methods with A/B Testing

This project analyzes the performance of two bidding methods—"Maximum Bidding" and a newly introduced "Average Bidding"—implemented by our client, bombabomba.com. The goal is to determine which bidding strategy leads to higher conversion rates through an extensive A/B testing approach.

## Business Problem

Facebook has recently introduced a new bidding method called "Average Bidding" as an alternative to the traditional "Maximum Bidding" method. Our client, bombabomba.com, has decided to test this new feature to determine whether Average Bidding outperforms Maximum Bidding in terms of conversions. The A/B test has been ongoing for a month, and now it's time to analyze the results with a focus on the Purchase metric as the ultimate success indicator for bombabomba.com.

## Data Set Story

The dataset includes data from the company's website, detailing numbers of ad impressions, clicks, purchases, and earnings. It is divided into two separate datasets found in different sheets of the `ab_testing.xlsx` file:
- The Control group, which has been subjected to the Maximum Bidding strategy.
- The Test group, which has been subjected to the Average Bidding strategy.

### Data Dictionary

- **Impression**: Number of ad impressions
- **Click**: Number of clicks on the displayed ads
- **Purchase**: Number of products purchased after clicking the ads
- **Earning**: Revenue earned from the purchased products

## Repository Contents

- `ab_testing_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the statistical analysis of the A/B testing results.
- `ab_testing.xlsx`: Excel file containing the dataset used for analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the analysis notebook.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, run the following command to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To view the analysis, open the `ab_testing_analysis.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook ab_testing_analysis.ipynb
```

## Conclusions

The analysis aims to determine the effectiveness of Average Bidding compared to Maximum Bidding in increasing purchases. Initial findings will be discussed in the notebook, with detailed statistical tests and visualizations.

### 2. Rating Products and Sorting Reviews

# Project: Rating Product & Sorting Reviews in Amazon

This project focuses on two critical issues in e-commerce: accurately calculating product ratings and correctly sorting product reviews. By addressing these issues, we aim to enhance customer satisfaction, improve the visibility of products for sellers, and ensure a seamless shopping experience for buyers. Effective solutions to these problems are expected to boost sales and customer retention for e-commerce platforms.

## Business Problem

In the e-commerce industry, the accurate calculation of product ratings and the correct sorting of product reviews are vital. Misleading reviews can significantly impact product sales, potentially leading to financial and customer losses. Addressing these challenges will not only improve the buying experience but also increase overall sales for sellers and the platform.

## Data Set Story

The dataset used in this project contains data from Amazon, specifically focusing on the Electronics category. It includes extensive metadata about products, user ratings, and reviews for the most reviewed products.

### Variables

- **reviewerID**: Identifier for the user who wrote the review.
- **asin**: Product ID.
- **reviewerName**: Name of the reviewer.
- **helpful**: Count of votes for the review being helpful.
- **reviewText**: Full text of the review.
- **overall**: Rating given to the product.
- **summary**: Summary of the review.
- **unixReviewTime**: Time of the review (UNIX timestamp).
- **reviewTime**: Raw format of the review time.
- **day_diff**: Days elapsed since the review was posted.
- **helpful_yes**: Number of times the review was marked helpful.
- **total_vote**: Total number of votes received by the review.

## Repository Contents

- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset files.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for analysis and review sorting algorithms.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis and methodological implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python libraries to run the project scripts.

## Installation

To install the required Python packages, execute the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the analysis scripts, navigate to the scripts folder and run Python scripts directly or through Jupyter notebooks:

```bash
python scripts/analysis_script.py
```

Or open a Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis_notebook.ipynb
```

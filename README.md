# Combined Project: A/B Testing for Bidding Methods & Rating Products and Sorting Reviews on Amazon

This repository hosts two distinct but crucial projects in the e-commerce and digital marketing domains. The first project analyzes the effectiveness of different bidding methods in digital advertising, while the second focuses on rating products and sorting reviews on Amazon. Both aim to optimize e-commerce strategies and enhance customer experiences.

## Project Overviews

### 1. Comparison of Conversion Rates of Bidding Methods with A/B Testing

This project evaluates the performance of "Maximum Bidding" versus "Average Bidding" introduced by Facebook, determining which method yields higher conversion rates for the client bombabomba.com. The A/B test focuses primarily on the Purchase metric.

### 2. Rating Product & Sorting Reviews in Amazon

This project tackles key issues in e-commerce: accurately calculating product ratings and effectively sorting product reviews. It addresses how misleading reviews can impact sales and explores methodologies to enhance product visibility and buyer satisfaction.

## Business Problems

### Bidding Methods

The introduction of a new bidding type by Facebook presents an opportunity to assess its effectiveness against traditional methods, with the goal of maximizing conversion rates for advertisers.

### Product Ratings and Reviews

Accurate rating calculations and review sorting are essential for maintaining trust and satisfaction among e-commerce customers, directly influencing purchasing decisions and overall user experience.

## Data Set Stories

### A/B Testing Data

The dataset includes impressions, clicks, purchases, and earnings from two groups: one using Maximum Bidding and the other using Average Bidding.

### Amazon Review Data

Data from the Electronics category on Amazon includes detailed metadata such as product IDs, user ratings, review texts, and vote counts for helpfulness.
